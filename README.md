Welcome to the experiment folder conducted by Vilma Helander and Hampus Ekedahl.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this experiment was sampled from LeetCode, a popular platform for practicing coding interview questions. LeetCode offers a wide range of algorithmic problems that are commonly asked during technical interviews.

## GPT-4 Folders
The "GPT-4" folders contain the prompts given to ChatGPT, as well as the generated solutions or outputs produced by the model. ChatGPT is AI model developed by OpenAI.

## Problem Set Folder
The "Problem Set" folder contains a list of all the problems used in the experiment. Each problem is accompanied by a link to find it on LeetCode, as well as the full question and a template for the starting code. This folder serves as a reference for the problems utilized during the experiment.

## Results Folder
The "Results" folder contains all the results collected from the experiment. This includes data or analysis related to the experiment's findings. Feel free to explore this folder to gain insights into the experiment's outcomes.

## Tools Folder
The "Tools" folder contains a GUI tool that was used to format and generate prompts for the experiment. This tool assists in structuring the inputs for ChatGPT, allowing for consistent and organized interactions with the model. You can refer to this folder if you are interested in the tool used during the experiment.
